<h1>The best movies according to Princess</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>A million ways to die in the west</h3>
<p>My favorite category of movies is comedy and this is just exceptional.</p>

<h3>The Dictator</h3>
<p>This is one of the best movies ever made. It's really a shame that the main character doesn't have a ton of movies out there.

<h3>The pursuit of happyness</h3>
<p>This movie always brings me to tears. i absolutely love it.</p>
